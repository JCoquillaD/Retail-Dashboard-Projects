This project is a Retail Performance Dashboard built using Power BI to analyze sales and profitability across products, time, and locations.
The dashboard focuses on year-over-year performance, identifying top and underperforming products, and understanding regional profitability trends to support data-driven business decisions.

*Objectives
Analyze Sales and Profit performance over time.
Compare current year vs previous year (PY) results.
Identify most profitable and loss-making products.
Determine which locations generate the highest and lowest profit.
Present insights using appropriate and effective data visualizations.

*Tools & Technologies
Power BI.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
Data Modeling & Measures.
Interactive Visualizations.

During this project, I learned and applied the following concepts:
1.  DAX Calculations
  - Reated measures to compute Sales, Profit, and Year-over-Year (YoY) comparisons.
2.  Year-Over-Year Analysis
   - Compared Sales and Profit of the current year versus the previous year (PY) to evaluate business growth and performance trends.
3.  Product Profitability Analysis
   - Identified the most profitable products and products generating losses to highlight opportunities for improvement.
4.  Geographical Performance Insights
   -  - Analyzed profit by location (state/province) to determine where the    business performs best and where profitability is low.
5.  Choosing the Right Visualizations
   *Used appropriate charts to clearly present insights:
   - Cards for key performance indicators (KPIs)
   - Line charts for trends over time
   - Donut charts for distribution analysis
   - Bar charts for product comparison
